Different tools in python!
### img/tools/imageme.py 
It was copied from the code https://github.com/unwitting/imageme and 
can be run in python3 env. It provides the function of moving an image 
from the source directory to the target directory just by click the picture in 
the web page. It's very convenient to classify the different images.
